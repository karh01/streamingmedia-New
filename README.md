Streaming Media is an old assignment I had done in 2022.

I have decided to redo it because it needed a lot of work. One of my biggest struggles is CSS. Through my time learniung front end web dev I have noticed I learn best when debugging code. So far I have noticed I pick up on the mistakes I have made in the past and I am understanding why things work the way they do!

What changed?

    - Nav Bar
    - profile picture
    - scroll Bar
    - hamburger menu
    - text is more readable and styled
    - All photos load in page
